What is the camera? Generally speaking, a camera is an optical instrument, which records or captures images. But it is more than that.  

Firstly, this machine itself is amazing. It generates meaningful 2-dimensional planes by sensing a 3-dimensional scenario. More precisely, 
it is a 4-dimensional scenario, because you can also involve time information. And the whole procedure is achieve by the light, which is an unpredictable, 
gorgeous and touching media.  

A camera can be as complex as the ones used on astronomical telescopes, and can be as simple as a box with a pinhole as well. The diversity of cameras 
is another very interesting thing for me. Although all cameras work on the same principle, different lens, shutters, sensors endow them with 
unique characteristics.  

Finally, an camera is an instrument for recording, but what to record depends on you. As Henri Cartier Bresson, a very famous french humanist photographer said, "For me, the camera is a sketch book, an instrument of intuition and spontaneity." You can record the landscape on your trip, your story, your thoughts, your emotion and so on.  

So I open this blog to share the interesting things about camera and photography.
